# Vue.js Frontend Test
This test is a sample of the day to day requirements at CNJ Digital.
  
The estimated time frame for completion of this test is 3-6 hours. Please keep track of the time spent as you will be probably asked about it. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask anyone involved in your interview process.

## Requirements
 - Use the latest stable version of Vue.js
 - The component has to be built from scratch
 - It has to look like the provided design file
 - It should be reusable, documented and tested
 - It should work on all major browsers
 
## Design
Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/yc3XQiFIXrYAaNDsUXemBN/Dropdown-Test-Design?node-id=0%3A1

## Goal
A Pull request to this repository with a working Vue.js component (it doesn't have to be a reusable package) and a sample use case. Documentation and tests are recommended. The component must look like the given design files ([Link](https://www.figma.com/file/yc3XQiFIXrYAaNDsUXemBN/Dropdown-Test-Design?node-id=0%3A1)) and be responsive.

## Tips
We suggest starting with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and Tailwind CSS.

## We are looking for:
 - Maintainable and testable code
 - Unit/acceptance/feature tests if deemed necessary
 - Separation of concern
 - Use common practices

Good luck :)
